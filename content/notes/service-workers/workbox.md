# Getting inside the (Work)box

## What?
- Google says: "Welcome! Workbox is a set of libraries that can power a production-ready service worker for your Progressive Web App."
	- https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox
- Workbox is a convenience wrapper around browser Service Workers providing a pleasant API to introduce Service Worker functionality into your browser (or PWA) apps, like:
	- Precaching
	- Runtime caching
	- Strategies
	- Request routing
	- Background sync
	- Helpful debugging


**Question: doesn't the browser cache already do this stuff?**

**Question: can I use service workers to precache "future" assets? E.g. user signs up for a masterclass, can we cache the masterclass video a few days in advance?**
